Description: The package can analyze spatial transciptome data to recover soft clusters together with corresponding gene programs. The package provides a fast function 'nnmf' to calculate the factors of non-negative matrix factorization for spatial data. It makes neighboring observations share similar weights for the different factors using gaussian smoothing in the multiplicative updates of NMF.
